# Project 1: Home Network Security Audit

## Objective
To identify all active devices on my local network and establish a baseline for security monitoring.

## Execution & Tools
- **Tool:** Nmap 7.98
- **Command:** `nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24`

## Findings
The scan discovered 2 active hosts:
1. **192.168.1.1** - Default Gateway (Shenzhen Sdmc Technology)
2. **192.168.1.3** - Local Workstation (My PC)

## Summary
The discovery scan was successful. The next phase will involve service scanning to identify potential vulnerabilities on the gateway.

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Research (CVE Check)
I cross-referenced the identified hardware manufacturer (Shenzhen Sdmc) with global vulnerability databases.
- **Source:** NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- **Search Query:** "Shenzhen Sdmc Technology

### Phase 3: Critical Vulnerability Identified (CVE-2025-8890)
During the audit, a critical vulnerability was identified related to the Shenzhen SDMC hardware.

- **Vulnerability ID:** CVE-2025-8890
- **Source:** CERT Polska
- **Description:** A critical flaw affecting SDMC NE6037 routers (firmware versions < 7.1.12.2.44), potentially impacting device integrity.
- **Risk Level:** Critical

### Final Findings & Status:
1. **Firmware Verification:** Checked the router administration panel. The current firmware version is **S09.44.03.029**.
2. **Update Check:** Confirmed that manual update options are disabled by the ISP (Managed Service). 
3. **Conclusion:** The audit of the home network gateway is complete. No further actions can be taken by the user regarding firmware patches at this time.
